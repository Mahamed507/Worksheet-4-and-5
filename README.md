A Java program that simulates a bookshelf using a custom linked list.
Book class with fields, constructors, getters/setters, toString(), and equals().
BookNode class to store a Book and a link to the next node.
BookShelf class (linked list collection) with methods:
insert() â€“ add a book unsorted.
insertSorted() â€“ insert books in descending order by release year (newest â†’ oldest).
remove() â€“ delete the first occurrence of a matching book.
toString() â€“ display all books in the shelf.
Driver classes to test each feature.
This project highlights linked list traversal, node insertion/removal, and object-oriented design in Java.
